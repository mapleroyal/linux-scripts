# linux-scripts

NOTE: This is a totally incomplete WIP for my personal use. Use anything you need, but I can't say if any part of it, including the instructions below, are finished.

Order:

- at chroot, run post-install
- reboot
- at root tty run nohomesubvol
- login as user and run yay then snapper
